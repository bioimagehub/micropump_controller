# Example workflow with microscope integration
# This demonstrates bidirectional communication with the microscope

# Required hardware
hardware:
  pump: true
  valve: false
  microscope: true  # Enable microscope control

# Sequence of steps
sequence:
  - name: "Initialize pump"
    pump_freq: 120
    pump_voltage: 150
    pump_on: true
    wait: 2
    
  - name: "Take first microscope image"
    microscope_acquire: true  # Sends CAPTURE, waits for DONE
    
  - name: "Wait between images"
    wait: 5
    
  - name: "Take second microscope image"
    microscope_acquire: true
    
  - name: "Stop pump"
    pump_on: false
